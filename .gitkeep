notes for code week 18 day 1

when creating a app you run npm run build

Build folder is the ready for the browser code

After building, examining our project's structure reveals a new BUILD 
folder containing production ready static assets including index.html, 
static/css & static/js folders, etc. If this React app was a frontend 
only app, the assets in the build folder would be ready to be deployed to any static hosting service.
This build folder of production-ready goodness is ready to be served up by an Express backend...

Code the Skeleton Express App

npm i express morgan serve-favicon

Then we will create server.js file for Skeleton Express App....

The -D is letting it be known that the dependency is only nessary for devlopment enviroment.
then add npm i -D nodemon

then goto package.json and add "dev": "nodemon server" in the script.

Now you can run backend by running npm run dev.
